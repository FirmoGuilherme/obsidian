| General Purpose       | Provides a balnce of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of workloads                                                                                                                                                                                  | Scale out workloads, such as web servers, containerized microservices, caching fleets, distributed data stores, and development environments                                                             |
| Compute optimized     | Ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors                                                                                                                                                                                                          | High-performance web servers, scientific modeling, batch processing, distributed analytics, high-performance computing (HPC), machine/deep learning, ad serving, highly scalable multiplayer gaming      |
| Memory optimized      | Designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Memory-intensive applications, such as high-performance databases, distributed web-scale in-memory caches, mid-size in-memory databases, real-time big-data analytics, and other enterprise applications |
| Accelerated computing | Use hardware accelerators or co-processors to perform functions such as floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching more efficiently than is possible with conventional CPUs.                                                                         | 3D visualizations, graphics-intensive remote workstations, 3D rendering, application streaming, video encoding, and other server-side graphics workloads                                                 |
| Storage optimized     | Designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications that replicate their data across different instances. | NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra, MongoDB, and Redis, in-memory databases, scale-out transactional databases, data warehousing, Elasticsearch, and analytics                                           |
